# Data Science Projects ðŸš€

This repository showcases a collection of data science projects which was assigned to me during my internship with [Codsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codsoft/mycompany/). Each project involves analysis, modeling, and prediction using Python. Below are the details of those projects:

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

**Description:** In this project, I developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, fare, etc. I explored the data, performed data preprocessing, and trained a model to predict survival.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 2. Sales Prediction Using Python

**Description:** In this project, I developed a sales prediction model using Python. The dataset consisted of historical sales data, including information about products, regions, and time periods. I utilized various data analysis techniques to predict future sales and identify trends and patterns in the data.

- seaborn

## 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Description:** The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. I employed machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing transaction information, including features like transaction amount, time, and various anonymized variables. The goal was to build a model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions.
